# D6_Evolution
Evolve D6 runaways by applying heating from Arepo code

The repo has three main folders:

1. make_co_wd_withoutneutrino allows you to create fresh WDs without any neutrino cooling.

2. Relax_WD allows you to relax the composition of the WD to Arepo or any other composition using a composition file.

3. Evolve_final_withoutHE allows you to heat the WD and evolve it for longer. The controls are in run_star_extras.
